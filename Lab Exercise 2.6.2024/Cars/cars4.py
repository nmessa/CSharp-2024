#At what speeds do cars collide?
##Car1 traveling north currently 2 miles south of junction
##Car2 traveling west currently 3 miles east of jucntion
#This is a refined version based up results from the previous problem
#A collision occurs if distance between cars gets to 0.001 miles
#Car 1 has a speed range of 25.0 to 35.0 MPH in 0.1 increments
#Car 2 has a speed range of 35.0 to 55.0 MPH in 0.1 increments
